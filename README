# HW-2 AES-128 RTL (Baseline)

This repository contains a minimal, stable **AES-128 encryption** RTL implementation and a reproducible validation setup against **OpenSSL** (reference implementation).
**No defenses are implemented in this baseline.** The goal is to establish a correct AES-128 core before adding countermeasures.

## Design Overview

### AES Architecture

* **AES-128 encryption only** (no decryption).
* **Iterative datapath**: computes **one AES round per cycle**.
* Round 0 (`AddRoundKey`) is applied on `start`.
* Rounds 1..10 run sequentially; round 10 is the **final round** (no MixColumns).

### Key Schedule

* AES-128 key schedule is implemented as a one-step expansion:

  * `rk_next = KeyExpand128(rk_prev, rcon(round))`
* The core generates round keys on-the-fly (no pre-expanded storage).

### Top-Level Handshake (aes_top / aes_core)

* Inputs: `start`, `key[127:0]`, `plaintext[127:0]`
* Outputs: `busy`, `done` (1-cycle pulse), `ciphertext[127:0]`
* `start` is accepted when `busy==0`.
* `done` asserts for one cycle when ciphertext is valid.

## Validation (RTL vs OpenSSL)

### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* OpenSSL (supports `enc -aes-128-ecb`)
* Icarus Verilog (`iverilog`, `vvp`)

### Run

From repo root:

```bash
./run.sh
```

You can optionally generate more vectors:

```bash
./run.sh 200
```

### What `run.sh` does

1. Calls `scripts/gen_vectors.py` to generate `vectors.txt`:

   * Each line: `KEY_HEX(32) PLAINTEXT_HEX(32) CIPHERTEXT_HEX(32)`
   * Ciphertext is computed by OpenSSL: AES-128-ECB, **no padding**, **no salt**
2. Compiles RTL + testbench with `iverilog`
3. Runs simulation with `vvp` and checks all vectors

A successful run prints:

```
Total: N  Pass: N  Fail: 0
RESULT: PASS
```

## Notes

* Baseline correctness is required before adding fault/power countermeasures.
* Build outputs (e.g., `sim.out`, `*.vcd`) are typically ignored by `.gitignore`.
